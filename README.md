## 📌 Introduction

This Deep Learning Web Application utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network to process the person Images and predict if their Mask is ON/OFF accuracy of nearly 98%.
Here this model is made by a pretrained model VGG16.
## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
As Social Distancing is only tool to prevent COVID-19 wearing face masks is compulsory.
To monitor the mass no of people whether they wear a mask or not I came up with a solution using deep learning
Here I can used Convulutional Nueral Networks(CNN) to predict whether the person is wearing the mask or not .
I took the person images with and with_out masks through web scraping and started working on it. the dataset consists of nearly 2000.

Our Model performs fairly well with an accuracy of 98% and an F1 Score of 97%. This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Binary Classification Problems where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.
